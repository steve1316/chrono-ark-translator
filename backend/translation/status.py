    1. An untranslatable_reason always wins -> 'untranslatable'.
    2. A translated row whose source text drifted since it was last synced or
       translated drops back to 'pending' for re-review. This is a shared rule for
       every game (WH3 'stale' folds in here).
    3. A synced row with no source drift -> 'synced'.
    4. A row whose target text shipped with the mod and was never edited -> 'untouched'.
    5. Any other row that has a translation -> 'pending'.
    6. Everything else (no translation) -> 'missing'.

    WH3 'orphan' rows (a translation with no parent source) are mapped to 'missing'
    by the WH3 adapter before this function is reached.

    Args:
        untranslatable_reason: Non-empty when the row cannot be translated.
        has_translation: True when the row has target-language text.

        is_untouched: True when the target text shipped with the mod and was never edited.
        source_changed: True when the source text drifted since the last sync/translate.
